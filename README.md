# BMW-website-CLONE
A sleek, responsive clone of the official BMW website, built using only HTML and CSS. This project showcases my front-end development skills with a focus on clean design, structured layout, responsive sections, and modern UI elements. Ideal for demonstrating mastery of semantic HTML and advanced CSS stylingâ€”no frameworks or JavaScript used.
